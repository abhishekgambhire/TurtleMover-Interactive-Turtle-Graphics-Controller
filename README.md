# TurtleMover-Interactive-Turtle-Graphics-Controller

### Project Summary: Turtle Graphics Controller

This project is an interactive Turtle Graphics controller built using Python's `turtle` module. The program allows users to control the movement of a turtle on the screen using keyboard inputs. Users can move the turtle forward, backward, turn left, turn right, and clear the screen to reset the turtle's position.


- **Purpose**: Provides an interactive way to control the turtle's movements on the screen using keyboard inputs.
- **Key Functions**:
  - `move_forwards()`: Moves the turtle forward by 10 units.
  - `move_backwards()`: Moves the turtle backward by 10 units.
  - `turn_left()`: Turns the turtle left by 10 degrees.
  - `turn_right()`: Turns the turtle right by 10 degrees.
  - `clear()`: Clears the screen, resets the turtle to the home position, and puts the pen down.

- **Keyboard Controls**:
  - Up Arrow: Move the turtle forward.
  - Down Arrow: Move the turtle backward.
  - Left Arrow: Turn the turtle left.
  - Right Arrow: Turn the turtle right.
  - 'c': Clear the screen and reset the turtle's position.

### How to Run the Turtle Graphics Controller
1. Ensure Python and the `turtle` module are installed on your system.
2. Run the provided code.
3. Use the keyboard keys to control the turtle:
   - Up Arrow: Move the turtle forward.
   - Down Arrow: Move the turtle backward.
   - Left Arrow: Turn the turtle left.
   - Right Arrow: Turn the turtle right.
   - 'c': Clear the screen and reset the turtle's position.

### Key Features
- **Interactive Controls**: Move and turn the turtle using keyboard inputs.
- **Screen Reset**: Clear the screen and reset the turtle's position with a single key press.

This project is a fun way to explore the basics of Python's `turtle` module and can be extended with additional features like drawing shapes, changing colors, or creating more complex patterns.
